Basically, this add-on should
1) a frontend to allow user to submit new campaign for approval
2) once approved by admin, the user/fundraiser can view, edit, or publish his campaign
In the frontend, the fundraiser can also see the donation he had collected for each campaign he had created.
A fundraiser can also be a donor too
After this add-on is completed, there should be another add-on to be built. The new add-on will be a frontend dashboard for the campaign manager / admin to manage all campaigns such as approve campaigns, suspend campaign, view donations of each campaigns etc
